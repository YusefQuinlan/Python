# Python
Python skills
This is just a compilation of some of the older and more basic python stuff I have made, I was going to delete it, but it is a nice historical reference. By the way, I know that these webscrapers are appalling, don't worry if I haven't committed the improved/more recent
webscrapers, I can make much better ones or I will upload them in the future.
